Transfer Learning :-
Transfer learning is a research problem in machine learning that focuses on storing knowledge gained while solving one problem and applying it to a different but related problem.
Transfer Learning is the reuse of a pre-trained model on a new problem. 
It is currently very popular in the field of Deep Learning because it enables you to train Deep Neural Networks with comparatively little data.
